# zotero2notion
This repository contains a simple script to import [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) records into [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). This can be used to easily refer to literature in Notion notes, either by [mentioning](https://www.notion.so/help/comments-mentions-and-reminders#mention-a-page) it or by using [relationships](https://www.notion.so/help/relations-and-rollups).

To use this script, some configuration is needed. Please refer to `config.ini.sample` for an example of this.

## Notion Template and Example
Furthermore, a Notion database with specific headers is needed. The database headers can be found in [this example](https://n3ls.notion.site/bb3c71f287c44b5dad54c2fb3b078521?v=8c41545e0e6e43999eeed9eb210c6ff5) which can be duplicated to your own Notion workspace.
